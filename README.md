# How does IOTA work? by Siraj Raval : https://youtu.be/B37UbzPlSzw

```
#Blockchain problems : ->,9:02

-Scalability issue : 
->10 min to confirm a transaction is too long for micro-transaction. 

-Fees: 
->Average Bitcoin's transaction is already  more than 1$. 

-Lot of computing poxer required:  
->Mining is centralized in Bitcoin by giant mining pools
-> More computer power to mine the same amount of Bitcoin. 

-Vulnarable to Quantum Attack: 
-> Bitcoin and other Proof of work are susceptible to be broken by a powerful quantum computer. 


# Tangle IOTA Architecture vs Blockchain: -> 9:03 to 15'42

-IOTA Architecture : DAG (Directed Acylic Graph)
->Hierarchy of nodes connected to each other in one direction (hierarchy of folders : git folder)

-Similarity with Blockchain : 
Distributed Database, P2P Networks, Consensus and validation mechanism. 

-First difference with Blockchain : it scales!!!
-> Tangle system / DAG grows when more participants make transactions, the overall system become more secure and faster. 
->As more nodes are added to the networks, transactions are made faster (inverse of the Blockchain)

-Second difference with Blockchain : no miners and no transaction fees!!!
->All the nodes are ou are not miners. 
-> In IOTA, every participant in the network making a transactions also participate in the concensus. 
-> Consensus in IOTA are no longer decoupled from the transaction making process. 
-> Quantum resistant. 


# IOTA Transaction : 3 steps process ->15'42 to 20'15

-step 1 : Signing 
->You sign the transaction with a private key creating the hash of the transaction. 

-step 2 : Tip selection 
->Use Markov chain Monte Carlo algorythm to randomly point towards two unconfirmed transactions (branch transaction, trunk transaction) that you have to validate before your transaction is validated.

-step 3 : Proof of work 
->In order to have your transaction validated  by the network, yo need to do some proof of work. 

- These 3 steps done : Transaction is broadcasting to the network 
->Someone else will come along choose your transaction and validate it. 

-To protect the network from certain attacks IOTA relies on a centralized coordinator. A node that temporary validate the transaction.  


# IOTA Cases : Internet of things ->20'15 to 22' 

- Data Integrity : 
->Data passed between this nodes is valid. Usefull for E-health, Insurrance, Legal, 
Critical Infrastructure. 

-Supply Chain : 
->Banks, Insurance Providers, Customs, Shipping Liners, Logistic company. 

-Bandwidth on demand. 

-Transactive Grids : share ressources. 

-> For the moment IOTA is a proof of concept.
